# Notes from November 14th, 2023

## Summary

- Last week the challenge to the Lifecycle WG was raised to the TSC. Julia Kreger from Red Hat was named interim chair until Gal is available again.

- We reached a concensus that multiple ways would realistically be required with a union of use cases, and that we really need to compose a document to this effect since some vendors are going to prefer specific ways, while that way brings other vendors concerns which has them desiring another way.

- We were able to record the meeting, https://youtu.be/Yl52sjKZH6Q
